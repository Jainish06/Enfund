a.  What is a VPC in AWS, and what is its purpose?

ans : 

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can:

Define your own IP address ranges.
Divide the network into smaller sections called subnets.
Control traffic with security rules like security groups and network ACLs.
Enable communication between resources in your VPC and the internet, or keep them private.
Purpose of VPC:

Security: Keeps your resources isolated and provides fine-grained access controls.
Customization: You can design your network the way you need (e.g., public/private subnets).
Scalability: Easily connect VPCs or extend them using VPN or AWS Direct Connect.
Networking Features: Supports routing tables, internet gateways, NAT gateways, and more to control traffic flow.
A VPC ensures your AWS resources are safe, organized, and flexible to meet your specific networking needs.

b. What are EC2 and Gunicorn in the context of AWS? Why are they used together?

ans :

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a service in AWS that lets you run virtual servers in the cloud. It provides scalable computing capacity, so you can host applications, websites, or any software that requires servers.

Think of EC2 as a computer in the cloud that you can rent and use to run your code.

Gunicorn (Green Unicorn) is a lightweight Python web server that can handle multiple web requests simultaneously. It is often used to deploy Python web applications like those built with Flask or Django.

Gunicorn ensures your Python app can handle incoming requests efficiently.

EC2: Provides the infrastructure (the virtual server) where your application runs.
Gunicorn: Runs your Python web application on the EC2 instance and makes it accessible over the internet.
By combining EC2 and Gunicorn:

EC2 provides the server environment.
Gunicorn ensures the Python app is fast, reliable, and can handle many requests at once.
This combination is ideal for deploying scalable and efficient Python web applications in the cloud
